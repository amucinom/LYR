Lyr is a website being developed to assist people with disabilities connect with others who have had similar experiences in hopes to bestow the confidence and courage they need in order to prosper with a lessened worry about assistance or caretakers. Individuals who are differently-abled do not get to have the “back to school” shopping experience that students who have all their senses do. Many items need to be purchased online, and if living with a roommate or in a dorm room, there is also the anxiety that they might not know the necessary accommodations or routines for their disability. People who suddenly lose one of their senses due to an accident or illness have a hard time adjusting to their new lifestyle, as well.</p>

With this information at your finger tips in one place, a non-disabled student can learn about the technology and lifestyle of their disabled roommate. A disabled individual can find a designated Lyr assistant with a similar story and obtain knowledge, personal product reviews, tips, and even one-on-one video chats or messaging with that person who has already experienced the situation. With a wide assortment of profiles, products, tips, and information, anyone who seeks such assistance can find everything in one place.</p>
